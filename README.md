# Digital Bazaar
Digital Bazaar is a small interactive Java console application developed during my time studying the FIT2099 unit at Monash University.

This project simulates a digital marketplace, focusing on the buying and selling of Computers and Printers. The aim of the project was to enhance our understanding of Object-Oriented Programming concepts, such as inheritance, polymorphism and encapsulation, in a practical, real-world scenario.
